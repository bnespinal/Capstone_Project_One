        Our restuarant started out as a small gaming store, which was a safe haven where gamers of<br>
        all makes would gather together to have fun. Over time customers began talking about how they<br>
        thought more could be added to the space. <br><br>

        After a year of debating as a staff, we decided to make the store into something more. So<br>
        we decided to start serving food, and after a long time of renovations we became the Empire Cafe.
