Description/Purpose: For this project, I have continued work on an HTML project, creating a restaurant webpage, 
and made it into a functioning webpage with access to data tables created in phpmyadmin. Among its functionality,
users of this webpage are able to register as a user and log into the site to be able to have access to additional
pages and functions only logged in users can see.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server.

Usage: This project can be used to view a restaurant webpage and use some of its functionalities.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to be able to enable email verification for this site where an email
message is sent once a user is registered. Also, I would like to input an order page on the site, allowing people 
to place orders and those orders would be inputted into and saved in a new table in phpmyadmin.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
